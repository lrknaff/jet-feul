>A URL shortener service.

This is an application that allows a user to create folders to store long, ugly URLs as shortened URLs.

The main goal of this application is to redirect a request at the shortened URL to their long URL equivalent. Each shortened URL should belong to a unique folder which is capable of storing N URLs.

The secondary goal is to track URL usage and provide popularity statistics.
